# AWS EC2 and Load Balancing Project

This project demonstrates how to deploy a scalable web application using Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). It showcases key components of cloud infrastructure such as instance provisioning, load balancing, health monitoring, and automation through user data scripts.

## What I Did

- Deployed multiple EC2 instances in a public subnet with custom inbound rules for HTTP/HTTPS access  
- Used user data to install and configure Apache2 web servers automatically on launch  
- Created an Application Load Balancer to evenly distribute traffic between instances  
- Configured target groups, listeners, and health checks to maintain service availability  
- Attached Elastic IPs and monitored traffic flow via the AWS Management Console

## Why This Matters

Understanding how to architect and deploy scalable services in AWS is fundamental to roles in cloud engineering, DevOps, and cybersecurity. This project reinforces how infrastructure automation, load balancing, and proper security group configuration contribute to performance, fault tolerance, and secure remote access.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Amazon EC2 provisioning and configuration  
- Load balancing with AWS ALB  
- Web server automation with user data  
- Security group and firewall rule setup  
- High availability and system health monitoring
